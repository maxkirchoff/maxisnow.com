		<h2><span class="highlighter">About</span></h2>
		<p>
			I am a multidisciplinary creative, technologist and philosopher. This is a fancy way of saying that I enjoy building cool stuff as much as I enjoy talking about it. My expertise crosses many fields and domains as does my approach to understanding. I am deeply interested in empathy and our relationship to emerging technology, and how this influences the morality of technology & the future of the human experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I live in Cleveland, OH with my wife and our 3 dogs.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also <span class="red">red</span>-<span class="green">green</span> colorblind.
