		<h2><span class="highlighter">About</span></h2>
		<p>
			I am a multidisciplinary creative, technologist and thinker. This is a fancy way of saying that I enjoy building cool stuff as much as I enjoy talking about it. My expertise crosses many fields and domains as does my approach to understanding. I am deeply interested in emotional intelligence and our relationship to technology â€” and how it influences our ethics & the future of the human experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			I live in Austin, TX with my wife, our daughter, and our dog.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am also <span class="red">red</span>-<span class="green">green</span> colorblind.

	<h2><span class="highlighter">Social</span></h2>
	<p>I have mostly left social media and shut down my accounts, but I actually really do enjoy chatting with people on the internet and sharing photos and life updates. That just isn't what social media is anymore.</p><p>I'd love for you to follow my substack, and I ALWAYS love to get replies and updates from folks.<p>

    <h2><span class="highlighter">Work</span></h2>
 <h3>The Zebra</h3>
    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/" target="_blanl">The Zebra</a> ðŸ¦“ at the end of 2020 as a Senior Technical Product Manager. After more than 4 years of running my own creative technology business, I was anxious to work for a large organization again - however The Zebra impressed me with their commitment to excellence both in their product and in their work culture. They have given me the opportunity to work on incredibly interesting problems and provided more support and care towards me and my entire family than any other job I've had before.</p>
