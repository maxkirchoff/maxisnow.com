			<h2><span class="highlighter">About</span></h2>
			<p>
				I am a multidisciplinary technologist and creative. My expertise crosses many fields and domains as does my approach to understanding and critical thinking. I am deeply interested in emotional intelligence and our relationship to technology â€” and how it influences our ethics & the future of the human experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				I live in Austin, TX with my wife, our daughter, and our dog.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also <span class="red">red</span>-<span class="green">green</span> colorblind.

			<h2><span class="highlighter">Writing</span></h2>
			<p>
				I occasionally have the chance to capture my thoughts in writing, to share with others and promote deeper discussion within my communities. Below are some recent thoughts related to my work and expertise.

					<h3><a href="/articles/product-management-technical-debt">Product Management & Technical Debt</a>
					</h3>
					<p>Technical debt is often a topic that can lead to debate and miscommunication as itâ€™s generally misunderstood in many industries, especially in tech and the *tech subdivisions (fintech, insurtech, etc). Within computer science, there is plenty of writing on the topic of technical debt: how to classify it, how to measure it, how to avoid it, and how to pay it down. However, I want to present it as a concept for the whole business to consider.</p>

					<h3><a href="/articles/quick-tips-early-stage-marketing">Quick tips for a consulting business on early stage marketing</a>
					</h3>
					<p>I occasionally get emails from folks who have found me or LAMA SIX who really just need some good advice. Iâ€™ll write them a quick email and try to save them time and money with actionable answers and ideas. This is one of those emails that I wanted to share, along with my responses for anyone who might be asking the same questions about their business right now.</p>

			<h2><span class="highlighter">Podcast</span></h2>
			<p>
				I launched a, now defunct, podcast with my creative partner, Isla Murray, called People Not Things as part of our search to find others who wanted to look at the people and relationships behind everything. You can find our podcast wherever you listen to podcasts or at <a href="http://peoplenotthings.party/" target="_blank">PeopleNotThings.party</a>.

			<h3>The Zebra</h3>
			<p>I joined <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/" target="_blanl">The Zebra</a> ðŸ¦“ at the end of 2020 as a Senior Technical Product Manager. After more than 4 years of running my own creative technology business, I was anxious to work for a large organization again - however The Zebra impressed me with their commitment to excellence both in their product and in their work culture. They have given me the opportunity to work on incredibly interesting problems and provided more support and care towards me and my entire family than any other job I've had before.</p>
	
			<h3>Wild Feelings</h3>
			<p>
				I'm part of the founding team at Wild Feelings, a start-up for individuals to learn how your emotions work and why that matters. We are creating a path to emotional intelligence for future leaders. Find out more at <a href="http://wildfeelings.co" target="_blank">WildFeelings.co</a>.
