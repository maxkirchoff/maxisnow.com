                p Starting my career in web development, I've worked across a span of engineering and project management duties. I am strong in cross-functional roles where I can provide insights and mentoring to junior people and clear communication with peers and seniors. Working through major features and smaller projects, I'm comfortable developing relationships with stake-holders to ease scope-creep and help provide understanding of technical details. I've also worked with complex projects, guiding with processes and methodologies from KanBan, Agile, Lean, and others. Over the past few years I have been developing my knowledge around product development and strategy, focusing on User Experience and leveraging analytics to make data driven decisions that users care about. I have served as both a lead engineer and a development director, deriving my leadership from my experience and credibility, rather than blind authority.
